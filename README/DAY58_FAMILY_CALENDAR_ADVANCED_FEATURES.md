## 🏗️ **DTO Architecture Improvements**

### **✅ Completed DTO Reorganization**

As part of Day 58 implementation, we performed a comprehensive DTO architecture improvement to follow proper clean architecture principles:

#### **Before: Issues with DTO Organization**
- ❌ DTOs were defined inside service classes
- ❌ Duplicate DTOs across different files
- ❌ Services using models directly instead of DTOs
- ❌ Poor separation of concerns

#### **After: Proper DTO Organization**
- [✅] **DTOs moved to proper directories:**
  - `DTOs/Family/SmartSchedulingDTOs.cs` - All calendar and smart scheduling DTOs
  - `DTOs/Focus/FocusCalendarIntegrationDTOs.cs` - Focus-specific DTOs
  - All DTOs properly namespaced and organized by domain

- [✅] **Services now use DTOs exclusively:**
  - `CalendarRealTimeService` uses proper DTOs with AutoMapper
  - All service interfaces reference DTOs, not models
  - Clean separation between data models and transfer objects

- [✅] **Eliminated duplicate DTOs:**
  - Merged conflicting DTO definitions
  - Single source of truth for each DTO
  - Proper inheritance and composition where appropriate

#### **DTO Categories Implemented**
1. **Calendar & Scheduling DTOs** (`DTOs/Family/`)
   - `AvailabilityUpdateDTO`, `AvailabilityMatrixDTO`
   - `SchedulingConflictDTO`, `ConflictResolutionDTO`
   - `SmartSchedulingSuggestionDTO`, `OptimalTimeSlotDTO`
   - `BatchCalendarOperationResultDTO`
   - `SchedulingAnalyticsDTO`, `SchedulingEfficiencyDTO`
   - `CalendarNotificationDTO`

2. **Focus Integration DTOs** (`DTOs/Focus/`)
   - `FocusSessionUpdateDTO`, `OptimalFocusTimeDTO`
   - `FamilyQuietTimeRequestDTO`, `QuietTimeResponseDTO`
   - `FocusAvailabilityBlockDTO`, `FocusTimeAnalyticsDTO`

#### **AutoMapper Integration**
- [✅] Services configured to use AutoMapper for model-DTO conversion
- [✅] Proper mapping profiles for calendar entities
- [✅] Type safety maintained throughout the application
- [✅] Performance optimized with efficient mapping
