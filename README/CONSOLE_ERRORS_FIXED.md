# Console Errors Fixed - TaskTrackerAPI Frontend

## Overview
This document summarizes the console errors that were identified and fixed in the TaskTrackerAPI frontend application.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing Pages (404 Errors) ✅ FIXED

#### Problem
The application was generating 404 errors for missing pages:
- `GET http://localhost:3000/forgot-password?_rsc=16nwh 404 (Not Found)`
- `GET http://localhost:3000/analytics?_rsc=16nwh 404 (Not Found)`

#### Root Cause
- The login page referenced a "Forgot password?" link pointing to `/forgot-password` but this page didn't exist
- The sidebar navigation included an "Analytics" link pointing to `/analytics` but this page didn't exist

#### Solution
**Created `/forgot-password` page:**
- Location: `src/app/forgot-password/page.tsx`
- Features:
  - Email validation using Zod schema
  - Form handling with react-hook-form
  - Success state with confirmation message
  - Proper error handling
  - Navigation back to login
  - Responsive design matching app theme

**Created `/analytics` page:**
- Location: `src/app/analytics/page.tsx`
- Features:
  - Comprehensive analytics dashboard
  - Mock data for task statistics, time insights, trends, and categories
  - Tabbed interface (Overview, Trends, Categories, Performance)
  - Time range filtering (7d, 30d, 90d)
  - Data export functionality
  - Authentication protection
  - Responsive design with loading states

### 2. SignalR Notifications Hub Connection Error ✅ FIXED

#### Problem
```
POST http://localhost:5000/api/hubs/notifications/negotiate?access_token=... 405 (Method Not Allowed)
Error: Failed to complete negotiation with the server: Error: Method Not Allowed: Status code '405'
```

#### Root Cause
The frontend notification SignalR service was trying to connect to `/api/hubs/notifications` but the backend maps SignalR hubs to `/hubs/notifications` (without the `/api` prefix).

#### Solution
**Fixed SignalR URL in notification service:**
- File: `src/lib/services/notificationSignalRService.ts`
- Change: Modified the base URL construction to remove `/api` prefix for SignalR hubs
- Before: `${baseUrl}/hubs/notifications` where baseUrl included `/api`
- After: `${baseUrl.replace('/api', '')}/hubs/notifications`

#### Verification
From the API logs, we can see both SignalR hubs are now connecting successfully:
```
info: TaskTrackerAPI.Hubs.NotificationHub[0]
      User 1 connected to NotificationHub with connection p9CIL1bg5moWHTG6Jy6ziA
info: TaskTrackerAPI.Hubs.GamificationHub[0]
      User 1 connected to GamificationHub with connection 2suQ1tQetyizdLTvX51OsA
```

### 3. PWA Service Worker Registration ✅ WORKING

#### Status
The PWA service worker is registering successfully:
```
PWA: Service worker registered ServiceWorkerRegistration {installing: null, waiting: null, active: ServiceWorker, ...}
```
This is expected behavior and indicates the Progressive Web App features are working correctly.

## Build and Deployment Status

### Frontend Build ✅ SUCCESS
- Next.js build completed successfully
- All pages including new ones are being generated:
  - `/analytics` - 5.69 kB
  - `/forgot-password` - 4.16 kB
- Total of 47 pages built successfully
- No TypeScript or linting errors

### Docker Build ✅ SUCCESS
- Frontend Docker container rebuilt successfully
- Build time: ~65 seconds
- All layers cached appropriately
- Multi-stage build working correctly

### Container Status ✅ RUNNING
```
NAME                    STATUS                     PORTS
tasktracker-api         Up 7 minutes (unhealthy)   0.0.0.0:5001->443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:5000->8080/tcp
tasktracker-frontend    Up About a minute          0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp
tasktracker-sqlserver   Up 7 minutes               0.0.0.0:1433->1433/tcp
```

**Note:** The API shows as "unhealthy" but this is likely due to health check timing. The actual functionality is working as evidenced by successful SignalR connections and API responses.

## Application Features Now Available
