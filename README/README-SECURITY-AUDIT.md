# API Security Audit & Hardening Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security audit and hardening measures implemented for the TaskTracker API on Day 32 of the 100 Days of Full Stack project. These improvements are designed to enhance the security posture of the API by implementing industry best practices and recommendations from the OWASP API Security Top 10.

## Security Enhancements

### 1. Security Requirements Attribute

A new `SecurityRequirementsAttribute` has been implemented to enforce consistent security standards across controllers. This attribute provides:

- **Layered Security Levels**: Public, Authenticated, and AdminOnly access controls
- **Resource Ownership Verification**: Ensures users can only access resources they own
- **Role-Based Restrictions**: Prevents users with "Child" role from accessing certain endpoints
- **Permission Validation**: Checks for specific permissions required for an operation
- **Granular Access Control**: Beyond simple role-based authorization

Example implementation in TaskItemsController:

```csharp
[HttpDelete("{id}")]
[SecurityRequirements(
    requirementLevel: SecurityRequirementLevel.Authenticated,
    resourceType: ResourceType.Task,
    requireOwnership: true,
    allowChildAccess: false)]
public async Task<IActionResult> DeleteTaskItem(int id)
{
    try
    {
        int userId = User.GetUserIdAsInt();
        await _taskService.DeleteTaskAsync(userId, id);
        return NoContent();
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        _logger.LogError(ex, "Error deleting task {TaskId}", id);
        return StatusCode(500, Utils.ApiResponse<object>.ServerErrorResponse());
    }
}
```

This replaces the manual security checks previously used across controllers, ensuring consistent security enforcement and reducing the risk of implementation errors.

### 2. Security Service

The new `SecurityService` implements the detailed security checks required by the `SecurityRequirementsAttribute`. It provides:

- **Resource Ownership Verification**: Ensures users can only access their own resources
- **Permission Validation**: Checks if users have required permissions
- **Role Validation**: Verifies family-specific roles
- **Admin Bypass**: Allows admins to bypass certain restrictions

### 3. Enhanced Security Headers

The `SecurityHeadersMiddleware` adds comprehensive security headers to all responses:

- **Content-Security-Policy**: Strict CSP to prevent XSS attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME-type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts browser features
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS
- **Cross-Origin Policies**: Secures resource sharing and embedding

### 4. Security Audit Logging

The `SecurityAuditMiddleware` provides comprehensive security event logging with:

- **Threat Detection**: Identifies potential SQL injection, XSS, and path traversal attacks
- **PII Protection**: Redacts sensitive information in logs
- **Request/Response Monitoring**: Logs details of all requests and responses
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies suspicious behavior
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitors endpoint performance for potential DoS attacks

## Security Pipeline

The security components are arranged in the following pipeline order:

1. **Global Exception Handling**: Captures and processes all exceptions
2. **Security Audit**: Logs all security-relevant events
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse through request throttling
4. **Security Headers**: Adds protective HTTP headers
5. **CSRF Protection**: Prevents cross-site request forgery
6. **Authentication & Authorization**: Verifies user identity and permissions
7. **Response Caching**: Improves performance while respecting security
8. **Query Batching**: Provides efficient operation batching

## Implementation Examples

### Controller Refactoring

We've refactored several controllers to use the new `SecurityRequirementsAttribute` to replace manual security checks. For example:

#### Before:

```csharp
[HttpDelete("{id}")]
public async Task<IActionResult> DeleteTaskItem(int id)
{
    try
    {
        int userId = User.GetUserIdAsInt();
        
        // Check if task exists and belongs to user
        bool isTaskOwned = await _taskService.IsTaskOwnedByUserAsync(id, userId);
        if (!isTaskOwned)
        {
            return NotFound(Utils.ApiResponse<object>.NotFoundResponse($"Task with ID {id} not found"));
        }
        
        await _taskService.DeleteTaskAsync(userId, id);
        
        return NoContent();
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        _logger.LogError(ex, "Error deleting task with ID {TaskId}", id);
        return StatusCode(500, Utils.ApiResponse<object>.ServerErrorResponse());
    }
}
```

#### After:

```csharp
[HttpDelete("{id}")]
[SecurityRequirements(
    requirementLevel: SecurityRequirementLevel.Authenticated,
    resourceType: ResourceType.Task,
    requireOwnership: true,
    allowChildAccess: false)]
public async Task<IActionResult> DeleteTaskItem(int id)
{
    try
    {
        int userId = User.GetUserIdAsInt();
        await _taskService.DeleteTaskAsync(userId, id);
        return NoContent();
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        _logger.LogError(ex, "Error deleting task {TaskId}", id);
        return StatusCode(500, Utils.ApiResponse<object>.ServerErrorResponse());
    }
}
```

This approach:
- Removes duplicated security code across controllers
- Ensures consistent security checks
- Makes security requirements explicitly visible in the controller method signature
- Reduces the risk of accidentally omitting security checks
- Centralizes security logic for easier auditing and updates

## OWASP API Security Top 10 Compliance

This implementation addresses the following OWASP API Security Top 10 risks:

1. **Broken Object Level Authorization**: Fixed through resource ownership verification
2. **Broken User Authentication**: Enhanced with JWT validation and security headers
3. **Excessive Data Exposure**: Addressed through DTOs and response filtering
4. **Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting**: Implemented comprehensive rate limiting
5. **Broken Function Level Authorization**: Fixed through security requirements attribute
6. **Mass Assignment**: Prevented through DTOs and model validation
7. **Security Misconfiguration**: Addressed through security headers and CSP
8. **Injection**: Monitored through security audit middleware
9. **Improper Asset Management**: Managed through API versioning
10. **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring**: Enhanced through security audit middleware

## Recommendations for Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Threat Detection**: Implement more sophisticated attack pattern recognition
2. **Security Telemetry**: Add security metrics dashboard and alerting
3. **User Behavior Analysis**: Monitor for unusual user behavior patterns
4. **Penetration Testing**: Schedule regular security testing
5. **Automated Security Scanning**: Integrate security scanning into CI/CD pipeline

## Integration Points

Security components integrate with existing infrastructure:

- **Data Protection API**: For sensitive data encryption
- **Authentication System**: For user identity verification
- **Repository Layer**: For resource ownership checks
- **Logging Infrastructure**: For security event logging
- **Rate Limiting**: For abuse prevention

## Security Component Test Plan

| Component | Test Cases | Expected Results |
|-----------|------------|------------------|
| SecurityRequirementsAttribute | Unauthenticated request to protected endpoint | 401 Unauthorized |
| SecurityRequirementsAttribute | Non-admin request to admin-only endpoint | 403 Forbidden |
| SecurityRequirementsAttribute | Child user request to restricted endpoint | 403 Forbidden |
| SecurityRequirementsAttribute | User accessing resource they don't own | 403 Forbidden |
| SecurityHeadersMiddleware | Response headers include all security headers | Headers present and correctly configured |
| SecurityAuditMiddleware | Request with SQL injection pattern | Logged as security threat |
| SecurityAuditMiddleware | Request with sensitive information | Sensitive data redacted in logs |
| Rate Limiting | Exceed request limit | 429 Too Many Requests |

## Conclusion

The security enhancements implemented on Day 32 significantly improve the TaskTracker API's security posture. By following industry best practices and addressing the OWASP API Security Top 10, the API is now better protected against common security threats and vulnerabilities. The centralized security approach with the SecurityRequirementsAttribute makes it easier to maintain consistent security controls across the entire API.
