## üîç What are Focus Sessions?

**Focus Sessions** are dedicated time blocks where users concentrate on specific tasks without distractions. They combine proven productivity techniques (like the Pomodoro Technique) with modern task management to provide:

- **Structured focus time** with clear start/end boundaries
- **Distraction tracking** to identify and eliminate focus blockers
- **Actual time measurement** vs estimated task duration
- **Progress tracking** on task completion
- **Productivity analytics** for continuous improvement

## üîÑ Complete Workflow

### 1. **Pre-Session Planning**
```
User Journey:
1. Reviews task list and priorities
2. Selects a specific task to focus on
3. Sets session goals/objectives (optional)
4. Chooses session duration (25min default, customizable)
5. Adds session notes about what they want to accomplish
```

### 2. **Session Execution**
```
Active Session:
1. Timer starts counting up from 00:00
2. UI shows:
   - Large timer display
   - Task information
   - Session status (Active/Paused)
   - Quick distraction recording
   - Pause/Resume controls
   - End session option

3. User can:
   - Pause session (preserves accumulated time)
   - Resume session (continues from pause point)
   - Record distractions with categorization
   - End session early if task is complete
```

### 3. **Session Completion**
```
End of Session:
1. Final time is calculated and recorded
2. User prompted to:
   - Update task progress (% complete)
   - Mark task as complete (if finished)
   - Add completion notes
   - Rate session quality (focus level)

3. System:
   - Updates task with actual time spent
   - Records session in history
   - Updates productivity statistics
   - Triggers achievements/badges if applicable
```

### 4. **Post-Session Review**
```
Session Summary:
- Total focus time
- Number of distractions and categories
- Task progress made
- Recommendations for improvement
- Option to start another session
```

## üîó Integration with Tasks

### Task-Session Relationship
```
One Task ‚Üî Many Focus Sessions
- Tasks accumulate time from multiple sessions
- Sessions are always linked to exactly one task
- Task completion is tracked across all its sessions
```

### Task Updates During Sessions
```
Real-time Integration:
‚úÖ Time tracking: Each session adds to task's total time
‚úÖ Progress updates: User can update % completion during/after session
‚úÖ Status changes: Mark task as complete when finished
‚úÖ Estimates vs Actuals: Compare planned vs actual time spent
‚úÖ Session notes: Detailed progress notes for each focus block
```

### Task Selection Intelligence
```
Smart Suggestions:
1. Overdue tasks (highest priority)
2. Tasks with approaching deadlines
3. Tasks user frequently focuses on
4. Tasks with good focus-to-completion ratios
5. Tasks in user's optimal focus time windows
```

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### State Management Flow
```
Frontend (React Context) ‚Üî API Layer ‚Üî Backend Controllers ‚Üî Database

Session State Sync:
1. Frontend initiates action (start/pause/end)
2. API call to backend with validation
3. Backend updates database and returns new state
4. Frontend immediately updates UI with response
5. No additional fetches needed (optimistic updates)
```

### Session Lifecycle States
```
Session Status Flow:
NotStarted ‚Üí InProgress ‚Üí Paused ‚Üí InProgress ‚Üí Completed
                    ‚Üì                      ‚Üì
                    ‚Üí Completed     ‚Üí Completed
```

### Time Calculation Logic
```
Active Session: CurrentTime - StartTime + AccumulatedDuration
Paused Session: AccumulatedDuration (frozen)
Completed Session: FinalDuration (stored value)

Duration Accumulation on Pause:
1. Calculate time since last start/resume
2. Add to existing AccumulatedDuration
3. Update StartTime to now (for next resume)
```

## üìù Implementation Notes

### Current Status
The focus session system has a solid foundation with proper session lifecycle management, state synchronization, and basic timer functionality. The core technical architecture is robust and ready for feature expansion.

### Next Priority: Task Integration
The most critical missing piece is deeper integration with task completion. Users should be able to:
1. Update task progress during/after focus sessions
2. Mark tasks as complete when finished
3. See accumulated time on tasks from all sessions
4. Get insights on task completion velocity

### Technical Debt
- Session validation could be more robust
- Error recovery needs improvement
- Performance optimization for timer updates
- Better caching strategy for session data
