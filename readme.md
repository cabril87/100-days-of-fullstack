# 💻 100 Days of Code – Full Stack with C#/.NET & Next.js

Hi, I’m **Carlos Abril Jr.** 👋  
I’m a Sys Admin and Full Stack Developer expanding my backend skills in **C#/.NET** and building modern frontends with **Next.js 14**. I’m using the #100DaysOfCode challenge to sharpen my skills in secure coding, API design, and full-stack app development.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Dive deeper into **C#** and **ASP.NET Core Web API**
- Build secure, scalable full-stack applications
- Strengthen frontend architecture using **Next.js App Router**
- Apply real-world secure coding practices throughout the stack
- Share daily/weekly progress to stay accountable

---

## 🏗️ Planned Projects

1. **Task Tracker API**  
   - Build a simple CRUD API with ASP.NET Core for creating and managing tasks  
   - Implement **Entity Framework** for database operations  
   - Add basic **authentication/authorization** to practice secure coding

2. **Inventory Management System**  
   - A more complex API with user roles, authentication, and data validation  
   - Integrate a **Next.js** frontend to manage inventory items and suppliers  
   - Employ security best practices (input validation, form sanitization, etc.)

3. **(Optional) Portfolio Rebuild**  
   - Rebuild my personal portfolio in **Next.js**  
   - Integrate a blog section or project gallery that consumes a .NET backend

Feel free to suggest any other ideas or if you have a favorite project you want to see built!
