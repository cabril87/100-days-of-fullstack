# 💻 100 Days of Code – Full Stack with C#/.NET & Next.js

Hi, I’m **Carlos Abril Jr.** 👋  
I’m a Sys Admin and Full Stack Developer expanding my backend skills in **C#/.NET** and building modern frontends with **Next.js 14**. I’m using the #100DaysOfCode challenge to sharpen my skills in secure coding, API design, and full-stack app development.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Dive deeper into **C#** and **ASP.NET Core Web API**
- Build secure, scalable full-stack applications
- Strengthen frontend architecture using **Next.js App Router**
- Apply real-world secure coding practices throughout the stack
- Share daily/weekly progress to stay accountable

---

## 🏗️ Planned Projects

1. **Task Tracker API**  
   - Build a simple CRUD API with ASP.NET Core for creating and managing tasks  
   - Implement **Entity Framework** for database operations  
   - Add basic **authentication/authorization** to practice secure coding

2. **Inventory Management System**  
   - A more complex API with user roles, authentication, and data validation  
   - Integrate a **Next.js** frontend to manage inventory items and suppliers  
   - Employ security best practices (input validation, form sanitization, etc.)

3. **(Optional) Portfolio Rebuild**  
   - Rebuild my personal portfolio in **Next.js**  
   - Integrate a blog section or project gallery that consumes a .NET backend

Feel free to suggest any other ideas or if you have a favorite project you want to see built!

## 📅 Daily Log

| Day | Summary |
|-----|---------|
| 1   | Created GitHub repo + README. Defined stack and roadmap for challenge. |
| 2   | **Project Setup Only:** Created ASP.NET Core Web API and tested default endpoints (no DB config yet). |
| 3   | **Database Integration:** Installed EF Core & Dapper; configured MSSQL; added DbContext; tested DB.   |
| 4   | **Data Model Expansion:** Added User, Category, Tag, and TaskTag models with relationships. Implemented entity configurations and proper foreign key constraints. Set up seed data for initial testing. |
| 5   | **DTOs & API Security:** Created DTOs for all models (User, TaskItem, Category, Tag) to properly separate data concerns and improve security. Implemented validation attributes for input sanitization. Set up authentication infrastructure with JWT token support. Created AuthController with register and login endpoints. |
| 6   | **Task Controller Implementation:** Create TaskItemsController with CRUD operations (GET all tasks, GET by ID, POST new task, PUT/PATCH for updates, DELETE). Implement user-specific task filtering so users can only see their own tasks. Add basic query parameters for filtering tasks by status and category. |
| 7   | Coming soon... |

## 🧠 Reflections & Lessons

This challenge is not just about consistency—it's about writing better code, thinking about **security** early, and building software that can scale. I’ll include key takeaways, fixes, and ah-ha moments here weekly.
