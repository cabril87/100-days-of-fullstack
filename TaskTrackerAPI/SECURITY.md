At TaskTrackerAPI, we take security seriously. We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and the broader community in helping us maintain high security standards. This policy outlines how to report vulnerabilities and what to expect when doing so.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in TaskTrackerAPI, please report it to us by sending an email to **security@example.com**. 

Your report should include:

1. A description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce the issue
3. Potential impact of the vulnerability
4. Any potential mitigations if known
5. Your contact information for follow-up questions

### What to Expect

When you submit a report, we commit to the following:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
2. **Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment of the report within 7 days.
3. **Updates**: We will keep you informed about our progress in addressing the vulnerability.
4. **Resolution**: We will work diligently to verify and fix any confirmed vulnerabilities.

### Disclosure Timeline

We follow this general timeline for vulnerability management:

1. **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
2. **Day 2**: Acknowledgment sent to researcher
3. **Day 7**: Initial assessment shared with researcher
4. **Day 30**: Target date for fix implementation (may vary based on complexity)
5. **Day 60**: Public disclosure (after fix has been released and tested)

We may adjust this timeline based on the severity of the vulnerability, the complexity of the fix, and other factors.

## Our Commitment to Researchers

We value the contributions of security researchers and are committed to:

1. **No Legal Action**: We will not initiate legal action against researchers who follow this policy.
2. **Recognition**: With your permission, we will publicly acknowledge your contribution.
3. **Communication**: We will maintain clear and timely communication throughout the process.

## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

We ask that you:

3. **Respect Privacy**: Do not access, modify, or delete data beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability.
4. **Do No Harm**: Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond what is necessary to verify the issue.

## Bug Bounty Program

At this time, we do not offer a formal bug bounty program. However, we do acknowledge and recognize security researchers who report valid vulnerabilities according to this policy.

## Legal Safe Harbor

We will not pursue legal action against security researchers who:

1. Follow this vulnerability disclosure policy
