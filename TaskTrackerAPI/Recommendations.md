# EmersSuite API Enhancement Recommendations

Based on the analysis of your current API and the requirements for your EmersSuite mobile app, the following recommendations outline missing endpoints and controllers that should be implemented to fully support your application.

## Core Applications

### 1. Emers-Tasks (Task Organization)
Your TaskItemsController is fairly comprehensive but consider adding:
- `/api/tasks/dependencies` - Manage task dependencies
- `/api/tasks/priority-algorithms` - Get smart task prioritization
- `/api/tasks/templates` - Create and apply task templates
- `/api/tasks/recurring` - Configure recurring task patterns

### 2. Emers-Remind (Reminders)
Enhance your RemindersController with:
- `/api/reminders/recurring` - Set up complex recurring patterns (monthly, yearly)
- `/api/reminders/preferences` - Configure notification preferences
- `/api/reminders/snooze` - Snooze functionality for reminders
- `/api/reminders/locations` - Location-based reminders

### 3. Emers-Todo (Simple Tasks)
Extend your current TaskItemsController with:
- `/api/todo/quick` - Quick add functionality with minimal required fields
- `/api/todo/checklist` - Sub-task checklist functionality
- `/api/todo/today` - Special endpoints for today's tasks

### 4. Emers-Family (Family Coordination)
Enhance your family controllers with:
- `/api/family/calendar` - Family calendar management
- `/api/family/events` - Family event scheduling
- `/api/family/availability` - Family member availability tracking
- `/api/family/permissions` - Role-based permissions for family members

### 5. Emers-Now (Focus Management)
New controller needed:
- `/api/focus/current` - Get and set current focus items

- `/api/focus/suggestions` - Get AI-driven suggestions for what to focus on now
- `/api/focus/distractions` - Track and manage distractions

## Extension Applications

- `/api/kids/tasks` - Age-appropriate task assignment
- `/api/kids/approval` - Parent approval workflow
- `/api/kids/rewards` - Child-specific rewards system
- `/api/kids/achievements` - Child-specific achievement tracking

### 7. Emers-Chores (Household Management)
New controller needed:
- `/api/chores` - Chore CRUD operations
- `/api/chores/rotations` - Set up chore rotation schedules
- `/api/chores/verification` - Verify chore completion
- `/api/chores/history` - Track chore history and statistics

### 8. Emers-Shop (Shopping Lists)
New controller needed:
- `/api/shopping/lists` - Shopping list CRUD
- `/api/shopping/items` - Shopping item management

- `/api/projects/resources` - Resource allocation
- `/api/projects/dependencies` - Manage project dependencies

## API Improvements

### General Enhancements
- Implement comprehensive filtering, sorting, and pagination across all endpoints
- Add bulk operation endpoints for efficiency
- Ensure consistent error responses and validation
- Add versioning for all new endpoints

### Data Synchronization
- Add websocket/SignalR endpoints for real-time updates
- Implement optimistic concurrency for shared resources
- Add offline synchronization support endpoints

### Performance Considerations
- Add cache headers and ETags for all appropriate endpoints
- Consider graphQL endpoint for complex data requirements
- Add batch operation endpoints to reduce network requests

## Implementation Priority

1. First prioritize the core application enhancements:
   - Complete Emers-Family calendar features
   - Add Emers-Now focus management endpoints
   - Enhance Emers-Remind for complex reminder patterns

2. Then implement the most requested extensions:
   - Emers-Kids for family engagement
   - Emers-Chores for household management
   - Emers-Shop for shopping lists

3. Finally, add the planning extensions:
   - Emers-Goals
   - Emers-Plan

Each controller should follow your established patterns for authentication, validation, error handling, and documentation.
