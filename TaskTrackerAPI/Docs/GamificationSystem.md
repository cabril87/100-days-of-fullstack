# Gamification System Documentation

## Overview

The Gamification System adds engagement and motivation elements to the Task Tracker application through points, achievements, badges, challenges, and rewards. This system is designed to incentivize users to regularly interact with the application and complete tasks.

## Key Components

### 1. User Progress Tracking
- **Points**: Users earn points for completing tasks, daily logins, and other activities
- **Streaks**: Consecutive days of activity are tracked to reward consistency
- **Levels**: Users progress through levels as they accumulate points

### 2. Achievements
- Pre-defined milestones that users can unlock
- Categorized by difficulty and topic area
- Award points when unlocked

### 3. Badges
- Visual rewards that users can display on their profile
- Earned through special activities or achievements
- Can be toggled for display on user profiles

### 4. Rewards
- Items or privileges that users can redeem with earned points
- Include both digital and potentially physical rewards
- Track usage status (redeemed vs. used)

### 5. Challenges
- Time-limited activities for users to complete
- Track progress toward completion goal
- Award points upon completion

### 6. Daily Login System
- Encourages regular engagement
- Provides increasing rewards for longer streaks
- Displays status information to users

### 7. Leaderboards
- Compare user progress against others
- Multiple categories (points, tasks completed, etc.)
