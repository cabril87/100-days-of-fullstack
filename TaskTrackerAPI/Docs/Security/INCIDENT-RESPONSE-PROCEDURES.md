# Security Incident Response Procedures

## Purpose

This document outlines the procedures to be followed in case of a security incident involving the TaskTrackerAPI. It defines roles, responsibilities, and steps to identify, contain, eradicate, recover from, and learn from security incidents.

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Examples | Response Time |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| **Critical** | Severe impact on business operations or user data. | Data breach, complete system compromise, sensitive data exposure | Immediate (within 1 hour) |
| **High** | Significant impact with potential to escalate. | Targeted attack, authentication bypass, API key exposure | Within 4 hours |
| **Medium** | Limited impact but requires attention. | Isolated vulnerability, suspicious activity, partial service disruption | Within 24 hours |
| **Low** | Minimal impact with no immediate risk. | Minor configuration issues, non-sensitive information disclosure | Within 72 hours |

## Incident Response Team

### Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities | Contact |
|------|------------------|---------|
| **Incident Commander** | Overall coordination of the incident response | security-lead@example.com |
| **Technical Lead** | Technical investigation and containment | tech-lead@example.com |
| **Communications Lead** | Internal and external communications | comms@example.com |
| **Legal Counsel** | Legal and compliance considerations | legal@example.com |
| **Executive Sponsor** | Management oversight and resource allocation | cto@example.com |

## Incident Response Phases

### 1. Preparation

- Maintain up-to-date documentation of system architecture
- Establish incident response team with clear roles
- Configure comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Conduct regular security training
- Maintain contact list for all stakeholders
- Document baseline system behavior

### 2. Identification

#### Detection Sources
- Security monitoring alerts
- Anomaly detection systems
- User/customer reports
- Third-party notifications
- Automated vulnerability scans

#### Initial Assessment
1. Gather preliminary information about the incident
2. Determine the affected systems and data
3. Classify the incident severity
4. Activate the appropriate response team

### 3. Containment

#### Immediate Containment
1. Isolate affected systems if necessary
2. Block malicious IP addresses or user accounts
3. Disable compromised features or endpoints
4. Preserve evidence (logs, memory dumps, disk images)

#### Short-term Containment
1. Apply emergency patches or configuration changes
2. Implement additional monitoring
3. Rotate affected credentials and API keys
4. Adjust firewall rules or security controls

### 4. Eradication

1. Identify and eliminate the root cause
2. Remove malicious code or unauthorized access paths
3. Patch vulnerabilities or misconfigurations
4. Reset and verify affected systems
5. Perform security scans to confirm remediation

### 5. Recovery

1. Restore systems from clean backups if necessary
2. Implement additional security controls
3. Verify system integrity and functionality
4. Monitor for any signs of persistent compromise
5. Gradually return to normal operations
6. Document all actions taken during the recovery

### 6. Lessons Learned

1. Conduct a post-incident review within 1 week
2. Document the incident timeline and response actions
3. Identify what worked well and what needs improvement
4. Update security controls based on lessons learned
5. Revise incident response procedures if needed
6. Conduct additional training if necessary

## Communication Protocols

### Internal Communication

1. Use secure communication channels (encrypted chat, secure email)
2. Establish regular status update schedule based on severity
3. Document all communications in the incident response log
4. Maintain clear escalation paths for unresolved issues

### External Communication

1. All external communications must be approved by Communications Lead
2. Prepare templates for different incident scenarios
3. Follow regulatory requirements for notification timelines
4. Provide clear, accurate information without technical jargon
5. Include specific actions users should take (if applicable)

## Legal and Compliance Considerations

### Regulatory Requirements

1. Determine applicable regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
2. Identify notification requirements and timelines
3. Preserve evidence in a legally defensible manner
4. Document compliance with regulatory procedures

### Documentation Requirements

For each incident, maintain a secure record of:
- Initial alert or report details
- Timeline of all actions taken
- Systems and data affected
- Communications sent and received
- Evidence collected and preserved
- Remediation steps implemented
- Post-incident review findings

## Specific Incident Response Scenarios

### 1. Data Breach Response

1. Identify the scope of exposed data
2. Determine if PII or sensitive data was accessed
3. Close the breach vector immediately
4. Follow data breach notification procedures
5. Document all affected records

### 2. Authentication Compromise

1. Force reset of all potentially affected credentials
2. Enable additional verification for affected accounts
3. Review authentication logs for unauthorized access
4. Implement additional authentication controls
5. Monitor for abnormal authentication patterns

### 3. API Security Incident

1. Identify the compromised endpoint(s)
2. Temporarily disable or restrict access if necessary
3. Review API logs for exploitation patterns
4. Implement additional input validation or rate limiting
5. Rotate API keys or tokens
6. Deploy updated API security controls

### 4. Malicious Code or Injection

1. Isolate affected systems
2. Analyze the code to understand capabilities and impact
3. Remove malicious code and deploy clean versions
4. Review injection points and implement additional validation
5. Scan for similar vulnerabilities across the system

## Recovery Testing

1. Validate that all affected systems function correctly
2. Verify that security controls are properly implemented
3. Test user access and functionality
4. Confirm monitoring and alerting systems are operational
5. Verify data integrity and consistency

## Incident Response Drills

1. Conduct quarterly incident response drills
2. Simulate different types of security incidents
3. Evaluate team response and procedure effectiveness
4. Document lessons learned and update procedures
5. Train new team members through simulation exercises
