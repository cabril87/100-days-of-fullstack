# TaskTrackerAPI Security Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the security measures implemented in the TaskTrackerAPI application. It covers implementation details, assumptions, security principles, and best practices followed throughout the development process.

## Security Architecture

### Authentication

TaskTrackerAPI uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication with the following security features:

1. **Token Structure**:
   - Access tokens with short lifetime (15 minutes)
   - Refresh tokens with longer lifetime (7 days)
   - Both stored in HttpOnly, Secure cookies

2. **Key Management**:
   - JWT signing keys stored securely using .NET Data Protection API
   - Automatic key rotation scheduled quarterly
   - Keys never exposed in logs, configs, or error messages

3. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Password hashing using Argon2id (memory-hard algorithm)
   - Rate limiting on authentication endpoints (10 attempts per minute)
   - Automatic account locking after repeated failed attempts

### Authorization

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Predefined roles: Admin, User, Child
   - Fine-grained permissions based on role
   - Resource-based authorization for family objects

2. **Resource Ownership**:
   - All resources tied to specific users or families
   - Security requirements attribute enforces ownership
   - Thorough authorization checks before any operation

### API Security

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Multi-layered validation approach
   - Model binding sanitization
   - Custom validation attributes
   - Business rule validation service

2. **Output Encoding**:
   - Automatic HTML encoding for all string outputs
   - Content-Type enforcement
   - JSON serialization security

3. **HTTP Security Headers**:
   - Content-Security-Policy with nonce-based script execution
   - Strict-Transport-Security with long max-age
   - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   - X-Frame-Options: DENY
   - Permissions-Policy restricting browser features
   - Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

4. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Global rate limiting (50 requests per 30 seconds)
   - Endpoint-specific limits for resource-intensive operations
   - IP-based and user-based limiting strategies

5. **CORS Policy**:
   - Strict origin validation
   - Credentials allowed only for trusted origins
   - Limited HTTP methods and headers

### Data Protection

1. **Field-Level Encryption**:
   - Sensitive data encrypted using .NET Data Protection API
   - Custom [Encrypt] attribute for model properties
   - Transparent encryption/decryption during database operations

2. **Database Security**:
   - Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
   - Minimal privilege database accounts
   - Entity Framework security best practices

3. **PII Handling**:
   - Personal data minimization
   - Proper data classification
   - Compliance with privacy regulations

### Attack Mitigation

1. **CSRF Protection**:
   - Anti-forgery tokens for state-changing operations
   - Double-submit cookie pattern
   - SameSite cookie attribute

2. **XSS Prevention**:
   - Content-Security-Policy enforcement
   - Input sanitization
   - Output encoding
   - Sanitized string type for high-risk inputs

3. **Injection Protection**:
   - Parameterized queries
   - Input validation
   - Sanitization of user inputs
   - Proper content type enforcement

## Security Assumptions

1. **Trust Boundaries**:
   - All user input is treated as untrusted
   - Internal services have appropriate authentication
   - Database access limited to application identity

2. **Threat Model**:
   - Protection against OWASP Top 10
   - Defense against common API attacks
   - Resistance to automated scanning tools

3. **Environment Assumptions**:
   - HTTPS in production environment
   - Secure hosting infrastructure
   - Proper network security controls

## Security Testing

1. **Automated Scanning**:
   - Regular OWASP ZAP scans
   - Static code analysis
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning

2. **Security Unit Tests**:
   - Authentication flow testing
   - Authorization bypass testing
   - Input validation tests

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Security header verification
   - Authentication token validation
   - Resource isolation testing

## Incident Response

1. **Detection**:
   - Security logging and monitoring
   - Alerting for suspicious activities
   - Audit trails for security events

2. **Response Procedures**:
   - Incident severity classification
   - Containment and eradication steps
   - Communication templates

3. **Recovery Process**:
   - System restoration procedures
   - User notification protocols
   - Post-incident analysis

## Vulnerability Disclosure

TaskTrackerAPI follows a responsible vulnerability disclosure policy:

1. **Reporting**:
   - Security issues should be reported to security@example.com
   - Include detailed reproduction steps
   - Avoid public disclosure until fixed

2. **Resolution Timeline**:
   - Acknowledgment within 48 hours
   - Initial assessment within 7 days
   - Fix development based on severity
   - Regular updates to reporters

3. **Recognition**:
   - Credit to security researchers
   - Public acknowledgment (if desired)
   - Bug bounty program (if applicable)

## Security Maintenance

1. **Dependency Management**:
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Vulnerability scanning
   - Security patch policy

2. **Security Review**:
   - Quarterly security assessment
   - Code review for security issues
   - Architecture review for new features

3. **Security Training**:
   - Developer security awareness
   - Secure coding guidelines
   - Security knowledge sharing
