# TaskTrackerAPI Implementation Plan

## Backend Fixes Summary

### 1. Fixed ID Generation in Database
- Created a migration (`FixFamilyIdentity.cs`) to ensure the Family table properly uses identity columns for IDs
- Added logic to determine the current highest ID and set the identity seed above that value
- Included fallback logic for different database states

### 2. Enhanced Delete Operations
- Added transaction support to the `DeleteAsync` method in `FamilyRepository` to ensure atomicity
- Implemented verification steps to confirm successful deletion
- Added cascade deletion handling for related entities

### 3. Added Audit Trail
- Created an `AuditLog` model and corresponding table for tracking database operations
- Implemented a trigger to log family deletions with relevant metadata
- Added indexes to improve query performance on the audit table

### 4. Improved Error Handling
- Enhanced the `DeleteFamily` controller endpoint to provide better error messages
- Added validation to confirm that deleted records are actually removed
- Improved status code responses for different failure scenarios

### 5. Added Migration Utilities
- Created extension methods to apply custom migrations during application startup
- Added direct SQL execution capabilities for complex migration scenarios
- Implemented logging for migration operations

## How to Apply These Changes

1. Run your application, which will apply the migrations automatically at startup
2. Monitor the logs for any issues with the migration process
3. Verify database changes via SQL Server Management Studio or similar tool
4. Test deletion operations to confirm they work correctly

## Next Steps

After implementing these backend fixes, you should continue with:

1. Testing DELETE operations to confirm they're working correctly
2. Implementing the frontend state management improvements
3. Enhancing the React UI components to handle errors appropriately
4. Adding proper loading states during async operations
