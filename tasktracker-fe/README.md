# TaskTracker Frontend

This is the Next.js 14 frontend for the TaskTracker application. It consumes the TaskTrackerAPI and provides a modern, responsive user interface.

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **API Integration**: Fetch/Axios
- **Authentication**: JWT with HttpOnly cookies

## Features

- Task management with drag-and-drop interface
- Real-time updates using SignalR
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Authentication and authorization
- Family/team collaboration tools
- Gamification elements

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env.local` file with:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   NEXT_PUBLIC_HUB_URL=http://localhost:5000/hubs
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open the application**:
   [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Integration with TaskTrackerAPI

This frontend integrates with the TaskTrackerAPI to provide secure, real-time task management. Key integration points:

- RESTful API calls for CRUD operations
- SignalR connection for real-time updates
- JWT authentication with secure token handling
- Implements all security best practices from the API

## Security Features

- CSRF protection
- Content Security Policy enforcement
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure authentication flows
- Protection against XSS attacks

## Implementation Notes

- **Repository Pattern**: All new services follow established repository pattern with interfaces
- **Type Safety**: All models in `/Models` directory, DTOs in `/DTOs` directory  
- **Code Standards**: Explicit types only (no `var`), proper namespace organization
- **Email Configuration**: Located in `appsettings.Development.json` with toggle for enable/disable
- **Security**: All password reset tokens expire in 24 hours and are single-use
- **Database**: Migration `AddPasswordResetTokens` applied successfully
- **Frontend Routes**: Password reset accessible at `/auth/reset-password?token=<token>`

## Project Structure

- `src/app` - App router pages and layouts
- `src/components` - Reusable UI components
- `src/lib` - Utility functions and helpers
- `src/services` - API service layer
