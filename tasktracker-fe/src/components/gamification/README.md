# Gamification System - Day 53 Implementation

This directory contains the comprehensive frontend implementation of the gamification system for the TaskTracker application. The system provides user engagement through points, achievements, badges, leaderboards, and daily login rewards.

## 🎯 Overview

The gamification system is designed to motivate users to complete tasks and engage with the application regularly. It includes:

- **User Progress Tracking**: Points, levels, streaks, and task completion
- **Achievements System**: Unlockable milestones with progress tracking
- **Badges & Rewards**: Visual recognition and redeemable rewards
- **Leaderboards**: Competitive rankings across different categories
- **Daily Login Rewards**: Encouraging regular engagement
- **Family Gamification**: Collaborative achievements and family leaderboards

## 🚀 Components

### Core Components

#### `UserProgress`
Displays comprehensive user progress including points, level, streak, and task completion statistics.

```tsx
import { UserProgress } from '@/components/gamification';

<UserProgress 
  showTitle={true}
  compact={false}
  showRefresh={true}
/>
```

#### `Achievements`
Shows user achievements with filtering, progress tracking, and completion status.

```tsx
import { Achievements } from '@/components/gamification';

<Achievements 
  limit={6}
  showRefresh={true}
  showTabs={true}
/>
```

#### `Leaderboard`
Displays user rankings with category filtering and competitive elements.

```tsx
import { Leaderboard } from '@/components/gamification';

<Leaderboard 
  showRefresh={true}
  showCategoryFilter={true}
  limit={10}
/>
```

#### `DailyLogin`
Manages daily login rewards and streak tracking.

```tsx
import { DailyLogin } from '@/components/gamification';

<DailyLogin compact={false} />
```

#### `GamificationWidget`
Compact widget for embedding in other pages like dashboards.

```tsx
import { GamificationWidget } from '@/components/gamification';

<GamificationWidget 
  showDailyLogin={true}
  showQuickActions={true}
/>
```

### Badge Components

#### `PointsBadge`, `LevelBadge`, `StreakBadge`
Display user metrics in badge format with customizable styling.

```tsx
import { PointsBadge, LevelBadge, StreakBadge } from '@/components/gamification';

<PointsBadge size="md" variant="primary" />
<LevelBadge size="sm" variant="secondary" />
<StreakBadge size="lg" variant="warning" />
```

### Progress Components

#### `ProgressBar`, `LevelProgressBar`
Visualize progress towards goals and level advancement.

```tsx
import { ProgressBar, LevelProgressBar } from '@/components/gamification';

<ProgressBar current={75} max={100} color="primary" />
<LevelProgressBar />
```

## 🔧 Setup and Integration

### 1. Provider Setup
The `GamificationProvider` is already integrated into the app layout:

```tsx
// src/app/layout.tsx
import { GamificationProvider } from '@/lib/providers/GamificationProvider';

<GamificationProvider>
  {/* Your app content */}
</GamificationProvider>
```

### 2. Using the Hook
Access gamification data throughout your app:

```tsx
import { useGamification } from '@/components/gamification';

function MyComponent() {
  const { 
    userProgress, 
    achievements, 
    leaderboard,
    refreshUserProgress,
    isLoading,
    error 
  } = useGamification();

  // Use the data...
}
```

### 3. Navigation
Gamification links are integrated into the navbar for both desktop and mobile views.

## 🎨 Styling

The components use Tailwind CSS with a consistent design system:

- **Color Scheme**: Blue (primary), Purple (levels), Orange (streaks), Emerald (achievements)
- **Gradients**: Subtle gradients for visual appeal
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first responsive design
- **Dark Mode**: Full dark mode support
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and loading states

## 📊 Data Flow

```
Backend API ← → GamificationService ← → GamificationProvider ← → Components
```

1. **API Layer**: Backend endpoints for all gamification data
2. **Service Layer**: `gamificationService` handles API communication
3. **Context Layer**: `GamificationProvider` manages state and provides data
4. **Component Layer**: UI components consume data via `useGamification` hook

## 🔌 API Integration

The system integrates with the following backend endpoints:

- `GET /api/gamification/progress` - User progress data
- `GET /api/gamification/achievements` - User achievements
- `GET /api/gamification/badges` - User badges
- `GET /api/gamification/leaderboard` - Leaderboard data
- `GET /api/gamification/login/status` - Daily login status
- `POST /api/gamification/login/claim` - Claim daily reward
- `GET /api/gamification/stats` - Comprehensive statistics
- `GET /api/gamification/suggestions` - Personalized suggestions
